# Neural Network Project with PyTorch

Hello there! Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence project. Here, I have embarked on a journey to explore the powerful capabilities of the PyTorch library. My goal is to implement and train a basic neural network using PyTorch, as part of an exciting learning experience. Let's dive deep!

## Project Overview

The task at hand is not to home-brew every machine learning solution from scratch. Instead, the beauty of Python programming lies in its powerful tools for scientific computing. Hence, this project leverages frameworks like PyTorch that are professionally developed and thoroughly tested. The main goal here is to explore PyTorch through an assignment template named `intro_pytorch.py`. 

### Part 1: Python Virtual Environment Setup

To begin with, the Python Virtual Environment is set up. This is an important practice when working with modern machine learning platforms, as it allows me to keep project-specific packages within their respective virtual environments, without interfering with the host system setup. You'll find the detailed installation instructions in the script.

### Part 2: Building the First Neural Network

Moving on, the task involves creating a simple deep learning model for predicting labels of hand-written images. In addition, there are 5 APIs implemented, through which the model is built, trained, evaluated, and used for making predictions on the test data. Additionally, there's an option to visualize the FashionMNIST dataset images for better understanding, although it's optional.

In terms of necessary packages, the PyTorch library is used extensively along with a couple of other useful modules. The core steps to achieve the final goal are to obtain a DataLoader, construct the model, train it, evaluate it, and finally make predictions.

## How to Use

The repository is organized in a manner that allows you to follow along easily. To get started, first, set up the Python Virtual Environment as described in the script. This will provide a secluded space for the project's dependencies. Once this is done, move on to the next part where you implement your first neural network model.

Training and evaluation steps follow the model building. Make sure you follow the instructions carefully to ensure a successful training run. To monitor the training process, printouts of the training status are available after every epoch. 

The final step is to evaluate the model and predict labels. If done correctly, you will be able to see the top 3 most likely labels for a given image, along with their probabilities.
